# Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
This project aims at cleaning the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) dataset for further analysis by extracting features in which mean and standard deviation is involved and clubbing the data, subjects and activities into one single text file.

#Files
* `tidy.txt` - consists of the cleaned dataset

* `CodeBook.md` - specifies the meaning of various columns in the dataset in `tidy.txt`

* `run_Analysis.R` - code that cleans the original dataset. Please change the path to various files in the code according to your local                       machine path
